# Harvest Player Electron App

This is the Harvest Player desktop app that replaces the legacy Adobe Air player app using Electron framework to build with web technologies.  

This application incorporates the following technology: 
- NodeJS
- VideoJS
- ReactJS
- RXJS
- Firebase Realtime Database
- Aphrodite

Firebase is used to control the stream URLs in realtime, if no firebase exists then it defaults to the streams configured in `src/config.jsx`
